##This is my project for learning OOP in python, I'm more focussing on the readability of
code, I know its a very amature code, but I explained every steps just for bare beginners
just like me, any suggestions welcome...
Thougts on gameplay
Developed the game with thoughts that it can be played manually as like in a reguler card gameplay
but the problem with this game is it take enormous steps,(some time..more than 5000..plays each)
I code it as automatic looping, you can make manual by adding simple condition in while loop..

##For beginners..
It is not good/playable game but you can make a fun and playable game with this idea...
just like the matchbox-card game..
i.e simply you put your cards in the table one by one each player, when ever the two cards get the same rank,
player with the last turn can take all the cards(whose turn matters), then alter the turn..continue till one player
got no cards at all
from this game you can make it easier..do that
